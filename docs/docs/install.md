# Installation 

[![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/NNSharp)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NNSharp)

NNSharp is available as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NNSharp/). It was built on Visual Studio 2015 with .NET Framework 4.5.2. The easiest way to install is to use the [nuget package manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui) in Visual Studio. As an other option the necessary dll can be built from the source code ([download link](https://github.com/adamtiger/NNSharp/archive/v1.1.zip)). The current release is the v1.1. It has only one dependency: [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/).
